            <p>
            Hello! I am a software engineer based in New York City. 
            Just a year ago, I was working as an elementary school teacher as well as a freelance digital illustrator. 
            Wanting to combine my passion for creativity and problem solving, 
            I began to explore and grew my passion for software development. 
            Now as a developer, I hope to use my skills to contribute to applications that benefit the lives of others. :)
            </p>
            <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy digital painting, listening to true crime podcasts, 
            watching documentaries, playing video games, reading novels, 
            and trying the colorful cuisines that NYC has to offer.
