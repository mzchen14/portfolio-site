            <h3>My journey...</h3>
            <p>
            Hi I'm Ming, a software engineer based in New York City. 
            After graduating from SUNY Stony Brook with a bachelor's degree in English Literature, 
            I became a lead teacher at an elementary school and worked as freelance digital illustrator. </p>
            <p>Wanting to combine my love for creativity and problem solving, 
                I dove into software development and realized my passion for programming. 
                I attended the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy to turn my passion into my profession.</p>
            <p>Now as a developer, I hope to use my skills to contribute to applications that benefit the lives of others. </p>
            <h3>When I'm not coding...</h3>
            <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy digital painting, listening to true crime podcasts, playing video games, reading novels, and trying new foods.
            </p>
