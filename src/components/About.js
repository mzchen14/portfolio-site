            <h3>My journey...</h3>
            <p>
            Hello! I am a software engineer based in New York City. I graduated from SUNY Stony Brook with a bachelors in English Literature.
            Just a year ago, I was working as an elementary school teacher as well as a freelance digital illustrator. </p>
            <p>Wanting to combine my love for creativity and problem solving, 
            I began to explore and grow my passion for software development and ended up attending the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack Academy. </p> 
            <p>To this day, I believe it was one of the best decisions I've made. I was able to challenge myself in ways I never imagined and came out even more immersed in programming.</p>
            <p>Now as a developer, I hope to use my skills to contribute to applications that benefit the lives of others. :)</p>
            <h3>When I'm not coding...</h3>
            <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy traveling, digital painting, listening to true crime podcasts, playing video games, reading novels, and trying new foods!
            </p>
